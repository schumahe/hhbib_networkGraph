## Network graphs built with the Python library Pyvis

The materials archived in this repository were created as part of a project work of the certificate course Data Librarian 2021/22 at the Centre for Library and Information Science Education at the TH Köln. The aim of the project work was to use data from the Hamburg Bibliography, which is compiled at the State and University Library Hamburg Carl von Ossietzky, to make family structures visible in a network graph created with the Python library Pyvis. In addition to this approach, relations between persons and occupations are also shown. See sample [visualizations](https://schumahe.github.io/hhbib_networkGraph/).
